# KPI Creation

The first step in KPI creation is deciding what data you will report, then create the SQL query to pull the data from the database.

In this screen you can edit an existing report, or you can create a new report.

{% hint style="info" %}
To create reports you will need to know TSQL, the best option is to download the database [backup ](database-backups.md)to create your SQL statement.
{% endhint %}

By clicking the name of an existing Widget, you will be able to edit the reports SQL statement.

Once you have your SQL Query working you will need to add a Chart.

* In the chart settings set the Name to a name of your choice
* For Chart Type select the type of chart you need, Area, Bar, Column, Line or Pie
* Put the exact name of your column in the Argument Field and the Value Field.
* Put the name of your Series Column
