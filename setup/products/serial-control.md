Serial Controlled Products

If your product always arrives with the same sequence for the serial number, you can add a serial number mask to prevent accidently scanning the wrong barcode into the serial number field. In the photo below the mask is DJ plus five digits. Unknown digits are notated with an underscore \_.

Example: DJ\_\_\_\_\_
