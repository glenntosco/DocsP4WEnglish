# User Sessions

\
&#x20;The **User Sessions** section provides a simple list of information about the various users basic activity within the Warehouse Management System (WMS). The User account name, Name, Client, and Role will all appear as completed within that user’s profile. IP will change depending upon the device or network from which the user accessed the WMS website. The Created column details the length of the user session. The Last Activity column details the amount of time since the user last logged into the WMS. Use the Action column to **logout** a corresponding user from the system.
