Carton Picking or Cartonization is a picking style where the P4 Warehouse tells the picker what box size to pick the product into. Cartonization follows a pre-defined Cartonization Profile. Depending on the regulations published by your Big Box client, as to how the cartonization profile will be configured. Once the cartonization profile is configured and created it is assigned to the Customer in P4 Warehouse. Then when a web dispatcher is processing orders for this client the cartonization rules will be followed to keep your shipment in compliance with your customers' requirements.

When the Pick Labels are printed the box size or name will be printer on the top right of the pick labels. The picker will need to retrieve the correct boxes from the packaging inventory.
