# Un-Picking

Un-Picking can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common is that the pallets did not fit into the trailer. In the event the pallets do not fit, you can simply Un-Pick the pallets and place the products into a bin.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you pick several pallets to one pick label, there is no process to un-pick only one pallet. It is CRITICAL each pallet has a pallet label and product is picked correctly to the corresponding pallets label.

Scan the tote label (carton / pallet) that you want to unpick.

![P4 Warehouse Scan unpicked product to bin](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (220).png>)

Scan the bin where you will store the products until a decision is made to what bins the products will be returned to.

As you can see in the above image the pallet is unpicked and returned to bin A-44-A with a quantity of 50.

{% hint style="info" %}
Orders cannot be unpicked after they are closed. Be sure of your processes, so you can unpick the product before the order is closed.
