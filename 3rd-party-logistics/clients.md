3PL Billing

Once the Enable billing box is selected the Client becomes a billable 3PL Client. By leaving this box unchecked the client behaves as multi-company.

Current Period: will show you charges from the last invoice to the current date.

Billing Cycle is Monthly, Bi-weekly or weekly.

Billing Cycle start: determines the starting date for invoicing, this is set once and will automatically update as invoices are created.

Auto-Post: If selected, the invoice will be posted and the email sent to the client, by leaving unchecked the invoices will be created in draft and still in an editable status.&#x20;
