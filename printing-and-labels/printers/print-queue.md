# Print Queue

The Print Queue allows you to view jobs sent to all printers in a grid format that is exportable. Column filtering is available on all columns in the grid.

Reprinting of a label job is done by selecting the correct row and clicking the Reprint Button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If label status is Printed but the label did not print, then you need to check:

1\. The printer is turned on, has labels and if required ribbon.&#x20;

2\. The server / computer that is running the print agent is turned on and has an internet connection.
{% endhint %}
