# Staging

Order Staging allows an order to be pre-picked. This is commonly used for orders that are shipping by Ocean Freight and must be ready when the boat arrives, or due to some other unknow factors the trailer did not arrive and the order needs to be moved to a bin location to wait for the trailer.

Once a pallet is picked in most cases it can be staged to an overstock bin location.
