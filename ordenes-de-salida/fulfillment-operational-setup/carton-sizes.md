# Carton Sizes

Setting up your box sizes is used for the process of Cartonization, if you will not be using Cartonization then it is best to not setup box sizes.

Cartonization is the process where the P4 Warehouse system decides what will be packed into each box. Depending on the box size and weight limits the system will decide how many boxes you will need and what sizes. This will help you meet "Big Box" compliance rules and prevent chargebacks.
